sys2minibex binary must be called with a .txt file that contains a problem.
See example.txt file for the syntax. .txt file(s) containing objective
functions and routh criterion are created. These files respect the minibex syntax,
exept that the division sign "^(-1)" written by Ginac must be replaced by "/".

sys2minibex.cpp calls needs Ginac library to be compiled.
