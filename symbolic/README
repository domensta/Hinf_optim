sys2minibex binary must be called with a .txt file that contains a problem.
See example.txt file for the syntax. .txt file(s) containing objective
functions and routh criterion are created. Then call the bash file 
omega2u.sh with file created by sys2minibex to make them respect the 
minibex syntax and replace the variable "omega^n" by "exp(ln(10)*n*u)"
and get rid off the logarithmic dependance on omega of objective functions.

sys2minibex.cpp needs Ginac library to be compiled: http://www.ginac.de/
